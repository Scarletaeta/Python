#I decided to use regex in a function to check whether all 3 types of brackets are opened/closed for a user input tell 
#them how many of each are unopened or unclosed.

#Methodology:   
#take user input
#get reg ex to match 3 types of opening brackets separately ({[ separately
#match )}] separately
#For each type of bracket:
#difference = opening - closing
#abs = abs(difference)
#if difference = -/+ 1, then  there is 1 unopened/unclosed 'x' type of bracket respectively
#elif difference < 0, there are 'abs' number of unopened 'x' type of brackets
#elif difference > 0, there are 'abs' number of unclosed 'x' type brackets
#else (if the difference == 0), they are all matched
